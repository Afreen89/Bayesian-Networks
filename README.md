# Bayesian-Networks
Implement a software application to solve Medical Diagnosis problems by calculating probabilities of Stroke and Heart Disease from data

### Tasks
There are three tasks.
1. Answer probabilistic queries by implementing Discrete Bayesian Networks.
2. Compare a range of approx. Inference algorithms and Structure learning. 
3. Compare the performance of Gaussian Discrete Bayesian networks with Gaussian Continuous Bayesian Networks
